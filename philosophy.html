    <p>Use it without an internet connection.</p>
    <p>Create a holistic technology where the individual decides the structure, not the computer.</p>
    <p>Have no one else in mind.</p>
    <p>A few is enough. So is one. So is none.</p>
    <p>The value is in the creation, not in the storing, retrieving, or sharing.</p>
    <p>The relationships between the things holds more information than the things.</p>
    <p>A thing can be simultaneously above, below, in front of, and behind another.</p>

    <h1>How others have defined “complex”?</h1>
    <p>A complex is a collection of thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and memories that focus on a single concept. The more elements attached to the complex, the greater its influence on the individual. —Carl Jung</p>
    <p>A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex software and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe. —Wikipedia</p>
    <p>Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, leading to nonlinearity, randomness, collective dynamics, hierarchy, and emergence. —Wikipedia</p>
    <p>A whole structure (as a building) made up of interconnected or related structures</p>
